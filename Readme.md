# Heart Disease Predictor

I have developed a python model to predict whether the person has heart disease or not?. I have used scikit-learn to develope the model.

## Follow the below instructions to run the application

### Installation & Running

1. Clone the repository files. 

2. Then upload the jupyter notebook file "Heart_Disease_Prediction_Model.ipynb" and dataset file "heart_disease_data.csv" to your google colab. 

3. Note that the dataset file must be in the same folder as ipynb file or else you have to update the path of the dataset in ipynb file.

4. Run the file in google colab.

5. See the comments and output of each cell. Try to learn from it.

6. This project was very useful to understand the concepts of Python and Machine Learning.
